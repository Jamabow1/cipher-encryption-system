# Cipher Encryption System (C++)

Object-oriented encryption/decryption system implementing classical ciphers using inheritance and polymorphism.

## Implemented Ciphers
- Atbash (substitution cipher)
- Scytale (transposition cipher)
- Ong (string transformation cipher)

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Rule of Three
- Manual loop-based logic (no STL algorithms)
- Modular class architecture
- Clean separation of interface (.h) and implementation (.cpp)

## Architecture

Base Class:
- Cipher (abstract)

Derived Classes:
- Atbash
- Scytale
- Ong

## Learning Focus

This project emphasizes understanding of:
- Object-oriented design in C++
- Resource management
- Algorithm implementation without STL shortcuts
- Clean modular structure
